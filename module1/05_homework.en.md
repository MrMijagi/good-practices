## Homework

### Pre-work

* Remember how to build a project in Debug mode
* Watch [is a video about debugging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFCQ37jVN3g)
* Make sure you have the debugger installed `gdb`
* Play around with the gdb or [onlinegdb.com](http://onlinegdb.com)

___

### Post-work

* Apply what you've learned in all your projects and homework to date. You don't need to re-submit the PR, but ask other people for a review if you have any doubts.
* From now on, when doing reviews to other people, pay attention to the best practices presented :)
* From boredom, return to tasks on [Firecode.io](https://www.firecode.io) :)
* Review the headings from [CppCoreGuidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md), and in your spare time read as much as you can :)
