## Philosophical questions

### a.k.a. joint retro

* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> How did you feel while working together?
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Were there problems that you did not foresee at the beginning?
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Was the estimated time of the tasks consistent with reality?
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> What went wrong?
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> What worked fine and you could suggest implementing this to other groups?

## Unexpected problems

The fact that we threw you a little into this project and forced you to self-organize was a deliberate procedure.
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

We wanted to show you how many things are not taken into account at the beginning before starting the project.
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

And even with several years of experience in project management, some things cannot be avoided.
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> sickness of team members
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> unexpected departures
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> additional, unplanned tasks
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> wrongly estimated task time
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> technical problems (computer restarting, git - conflicts, interrupting the internet)
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> changing requirements or their interpretations

## Task estimation

The theory suggests that a fairly cool way to better estimate tasks is to multiply the initial estimate by PI üòÑ
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

Other sources indicate that an order of magnitude should be increased (e.g. from 5 hours to 5 days, from 3 days to 3 weeks, etc.) üòÑ
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

In practice, poker is used for estimation

### Rules

* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> We do not estimate tasks in units of time.
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> We choose one task for the whole team that is the easiest of all. We give it the value of 1.
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> We only use the values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ‚ôæ,? - I have no idea, ‚òïÔ∏è). Thanks to this, we focus more on orders of magnitude than on the units themselves, because there is no big difference between 9 and 10.
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> The unit is Story Points (SP). This is a completely abstract measure. You can think of it as any other abstract. For example, this task is valued at 5 chestnuts. This information is completely useless, but it allows you to compare tasks. Since that is worth 8, it is more valuable (more difficult).
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> For one person, 1 SP may mean 1 hour of work, and for another - 1 day.

___

### The course of the estimation

* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> We discuss one selected task with the whole team to make sure that everyone understands it the same.
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> When everyone is ready they _simultaneously_ draw the card with their estimate so as not to be influenced by others
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> If the discrepancy is large, it means that team members have a different understanding of the task and still need to be discussed. It is worth asking people with the lowest and highest estimate why they give so much.
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> If the discrepancies are small, you can average them or agree to some value (usually higher)

Look for online Scrum Poker tools and use them to estimate tasks in Planning.

## Collective responsibility

It's hard to blame someone for getting sick. But you can blame him for committing to something and not letting him know that it won't work. So it's important daily to get in the habit of updating your status at least daily. Of course you can more often.
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

As soon as you find out that someone from the crew is ailing you, you should think immediately what to do about it. If the works were started, what has been done so far should be communicated / communicated. This is another reason why small and frequent commits are a good practice. Everyone has access to the current version of the code and it's easy to donate work.
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

For us, outside observers, we can never judge how much each team has done. The team just did it for us. If you feel that you are doing too much / too little and something is unfair, you can write us about your problems and change the team if necessary.

## Good practices for team cooperation

* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Pair programming
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Mob programming
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Peer code review
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Deliver jobs as quickly as possible. Better to deliver 4 out of 8 tasks by working 2 people on each other than 0/8 having all started at the same time.
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> No top-down assignments of people to tasks. The person who just has time takes the first task in advance (or one of the first, if not blocked)
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> 1 person can only be assigned 1 task at a time. Only after completing the previous quest can you take another one.

## [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org)

> We discover new programming methods thanks to programming practice and supporting others in it. As a result of our work, we began to value more:
>
> **People and interactions** from processes and tools
>
> **Working software** from detailed documentation
>
> **Cooperation with the client** from negotiating contracts
>
> **Responding to changes** from the implementation of the assumed plan.
>
> This means that the items on the right are valuable, but the ones on the left are more valuable to us.
